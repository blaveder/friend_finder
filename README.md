# Friend Finder Application

### Description..
 A simple friend finder but with...Rugrats...the love-able 90's cartoon that was on for like 14 years or something.   I used *materilized* for most of the css, *node.js and *express* as well as the modal pop up thingy.  The app shows allows the user to choose from **10 questions** once the user does that a pop-up will appear with the best match.  The match goes to the friendlist for more possibilities.
